# Frontend Mentor - Single-page developer portfolio

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this single-page portfolio and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So, if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)

### Expected behaviour

When the user clicks the "Contact me" call-to-action in the hero or projects section, the browser should scroll down to the contact form.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="grid-row">
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>4 Years Experience</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>4 Years Experience</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>4 Years Experience</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>4 Years Experience</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>React</h3>
        <p>3 Years Experience</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Sass</h3>

      </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.text-type {
    background: none;
    border: none;
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--white);
    color: var(--white);
    caret-color: var(--white);
    outline: none;
    width: 27.813rem;
}
```
```js

```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - Resource used to create the image overlay effect on the projects section.
- []() - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
